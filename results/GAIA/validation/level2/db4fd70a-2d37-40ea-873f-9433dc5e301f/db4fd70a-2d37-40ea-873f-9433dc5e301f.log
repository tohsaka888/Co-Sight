   Notes: Successfully researched the official MBTA website for information on the Franklin-Foxboro line. Found that the line connects South Station to Foxboro with multiple stops including Windsor Gardens. The information is current and up-to-date (even showing schedules for 2025, which is well beyond the May 2023 requirement). The MBTA website provides the official route map and station listings for the Franklin-Foxboro line.
Step1 :[ ] Find an official route map or station listing for the Franklin-Foxboro line (depends on: 0)
Step2 :[ ] Identify the complete sequence of stops on the Franklin-Foxboro line (depends on: 1)
Step3 :[ ] Locate South Station and Windsor Gardens on the route list (depends on: 2)
Step4 :[ ] Count the number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens (excluding these two stations) (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Verify the information is current as of May 2023 (depends on: 2)
Step6 :[ ] Compile the final answer with the exact number of stops (depends on: 4, 5)

Plan: Research MBTA Franklin-Foxboro Line Stops Between South Station and Windsor Gardens
==========================================================================================

Progress: 4/6 steps completed (66.7%)
Status: 4 completed, 0 in progress, 0 blocked, 2 not started

Steps:
Step0 :[?] Research the official MBTA website for information on the Franklin-Foxboro line
   Notes: Successfully researched the official MBTA website for information on the Franklin-Foxboro line. Found that the line connects South Station to Foxboro with multiple stops including Windsor Gardens. The information is current and up-to-date (even showing schedules for 2025, which is well beyond the May 2023 requirement). The MBTA website provides the official route map and station listings for the Franklin-Foxboro line.
Step1 :[?] Find an official route map or station listing for the Franklin-Foxboro line (depends on: 0)
   Notes: Successfully found the official station listing for the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line. The complete list of stations on the line was obtained from the official MBTA website. The Franklin/Foxboro Line includes the following stations in order from South Station: South Station, Back Bay, Ruggles, Forest Hills, Hyde Park, Readville, Endicott, Dedham Corporate Center, Islington, Norwood Depot, Norwood Central, Windsor Gardens, Foxboro, Walpole, Norfolk, Franklin, and Forge Park/495. This information is current and from the official MBTA source.
Step2 :[?] Identify the complete sequence of stops on the Franklin-Foxboro line (depends on: 1)
   Notes: Successfully identified the complete sequence of stops on the MBTA Franklin-Foxboro line from South Station to Windsor Gardens. The sequence is:
1. South Station
2. Back Bay
3. Ruggles
4. Forest Hills (not all trains stop here)
5. Hyde Park (not all trains stop here)
6. Readville
7. Endicott
8. Dedham Corporate Center
9. Islington
10. Norwood Depot
11. Norwood Central
12. Windsor Gardens

This information was obtained directly from the official MBTA website and represents the current station sequence on the Franklin Line.
Step3 :[?] Count the number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens (excluding these two stations) (depends on: 2)
   Notes: Successfully counted the number of stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens on the MBTA's Franklin-Foxboro line, excluding these two endpoints. Based on the sequence identified in Step 2, there are 10 stops between South Station and Windsor Gardens: Back Bay, Ruggles, Forest Hills, Hyde Park, Readville, Endicott, Dedham Corporate Center, Islington, Norwood Depot, and Norwood Central.
Step4 :[ ] Verify the information is current as of May 2023 (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Compile the final answer with the exact number of stops (depends on: 4)
