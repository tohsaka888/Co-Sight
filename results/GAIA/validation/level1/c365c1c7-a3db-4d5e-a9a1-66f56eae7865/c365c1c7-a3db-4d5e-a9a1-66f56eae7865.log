The next step is to calculate the distance between these two cities.
Step3 :[?] Verify the two cities with the farthest distance (depends on: 2)
   Notes: The two cities with the farthest distance have been verified as Honolulu, Hawaii (westernmost) and Braintree, Massachusetts (easternmost). The distance calculation was not required for verification since the geographic coordinates clearly indicate their positions. Next step is to sort these two cities alphabetically.
Step4 :[ ] Sort the two cities alphabetically (depends on: 3)
Step5 :[ ] Provide the final answer in a comma-separated list (depends on: 4)
